### `Javascript 2d engine` in progress
  All internal engine code is stored in teh 'core' folder, the main parent class is FrameDisplay
  All 'user' code is stored in the 'user' folder
  
  The main idea is that user can create a IViewEntity to describe how a FrameComponent (like a ball on the screen) will look. The user can then add Animations to the FrameComponent (like moving on arrow key presses)
  

### `npm start`
